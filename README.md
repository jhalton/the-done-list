# The Done List

Ok. We are tracking changes. Hooray!

### Brain Dump

<br>
♥ Can have multiple goals
<br>
♥ Each goal has a "Why" portion bc I think it's important to understand WHY you are doing something
<br>
♥ Backend needs: Users, Goals,
<br>
♥ Goals can be set for different increments (i.e. 30 days, 7 days, etc) or just frequency?
<br>
♥ I would like the option to be able to go back and see the goals that have been completed.
<br>
♥ If a User hasn't engaged in goals for 3(?) days, push reminder to check in, see if they aren't
working on goals or simply aren't tracking them.
